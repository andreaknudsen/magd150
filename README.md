I have added three zip files to my repositories: **Assignment 5, 7, and 8**. These assignments are from the course "Introduction to Media Arts and Game Development". 

### Assignment 5
In this assignment I was working with Buttons and Interactivity. I had to design a composition that looked like either a television or desktop computer. Furthermore I needed to incorporate these:
* Two buttons, one rectangle and one ellipse. These had to be activated by either
  * mouseClicked()
  * mousePressed()
* Another button using keyPressed()
* Two if or if else statements
* A color scheme with up to five colors 
* Allignment, proximity and similarity
* Scale and proportion



### Assignment 7
This assignment is about functions and I had to create a composition that represents either weather or a retro game. I choose to go with weather. I had to incorporate these elements:
* Create a function that draws a shape from other shapes, such as lines or dots. Position this by calling it, giving it x and y coordinates and using translate() to move it.
* Create multiple copies of your function by using a for() loop
* Use scale()
* Use rotate()
* Set angleMode() to the wished measurement 
* Use push() and pop()
* Create function that returns a value and use print() to sent it to the consol



### Assignment 8
Assignment 8 is about using images and text in your design. To do this assignment (and to see the finished product) use [Web Server for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en). I decided to do a Spongebob themed assignment. I ad to incorporate these elements:

**Images**
* Load min. two pictures
* Use mouseX and/or mouseY to change the location or size of one of the pictures
* Load transparent .gif or .png file
* Use the mouseX and/or mouseY to change the image's location


**Text**
* Use text function
* Choose a system font by using textFont
* Change the stroke and fill of a font
* Create text and use height and width measurements to limit the area the text can be in
